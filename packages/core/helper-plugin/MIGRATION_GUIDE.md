# Helper-plugin Migration Guide

This document has been written incrementally to help developers migrate their strapi plugins & applications to _not_ use the `helper-plugin` package.
It is written in alphabetical order grouped by domain based on _every_ export that existed in the aforementioned package.

## Components

### AnErrorOccurred

This component has been removed and refactored to be part of the `Page` component exported from `@strapi/strapi/admin`. You should use the `Page` component from there:

```tsx
// Before
import { AnErrorOccurred } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

// After
import { Page } from '@strapi/strapi/admin';

const MyPage = () => {
  // ...

  if (error) {
    return <Page.Error />;
  }

  // ...
};
```

### CheckPermissions

This component has been removed and not replaced. If you feel like you need this component, please open an issue on the Strapi repository to discuss your usecase.

### CheckPagePermissions

This component has been removed and refactored to be part of the `Page` component exported from `@strapi/strapi/admin`. You should use the `Page` component from there:

```tsx
// Before
import { CheckPagePermissions } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

// After
import { Page } from '@strapi/strapi/admin';

const MyProtectedPage = () => {
  return (
    <Page.Protect permissions={[action: 'plugin::my-plugin.read']}>
      <MyPage />
    </Page.Protect>
  );
};
```

The behaviour has slightly changed, where previously no permissions would redirect you to the root of the page, now it will render the `NoPermissions` component.

###Â ConfirmDialog

This component has been moved and refactored. It can imported from the `@strapi/strapi/admin` package:

```tsx
// Before
import { ConfirmDialog } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

// After
import { ConfirmDialog } from '@strapi/strapi/admin';
```

Please see the documentation for the `ConfirmDialog` component for more information.

### ContentBox

This component has been removed and not replaced. If you feel like you need this component, please open an issue on the Strapi repository to discuss your usecase.

### DateTimePicker

This was aliasing the design-system. You should import the component from there:

```tsx
// Before
import { DateTimePicker } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

// After
import { DateTimePicker } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

### DynamicTable

This component was previously deprecated and has now been removed. Similar to the deprecation notice, we recommend using the `Table` component from `@strapi/strapi/admin`.

### EmptyBodyTable

This component has been removed and is part of the `Table` component.

### EmptyStateLayout

This component has been removed and not replaced. You should use `EmptyStateLayout` from `@strapi/design-system`:

```tsx
// Before
import { EmptyStateLayout } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

// After
import { EmptyStateLayout } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

NOTE! the props will be different. Please refer to the documentation for the `EmptyStateLayout` component.

### FilterListURLQuery

This component was moved to the `admin` package and can now be imported via the `@strapi/strapi` package as part of the composite component `Filters`:

```tsx
// Before
import { FilterListURLQuery } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

// After
import { Filters } from '@strapi/strapi/admin';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Filters.Root>
      <Filters.List />
    </Filters.Root>
  );
};
```

### FilterPopoverURLQueryProps

This component was moved to the `admin` package and can now be imported via the `@strapi/strapi` package as part of the composite component `Filters`:

```tsx
// Before
import { FilterPopoverURLQueryProps } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

// After
import { Filters } from '@strapi/strapi/admin';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Filters.Root>
      <Filters.Trigger />
      <Filters.Popover />
    </Filters.Root>
  );
};
```

### Form

This component aliased `Formik`, something we're working towards removing. The `Form` component and it's sibling exports from `@strapi/strapi/admin` should be used instead:

```tsx
// Before
import { Form } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

// After
import { Form } from '@strapi/strapi/admin';
```

Users should note that any use of the Formik library will no longer work & insted should look at the documentation for the `Form` component.

### GenericInput

This component has been removed and refactored to become the `InputRenderer` component exported from `@strapi/strapi/admin`. You should use the `InputRenderer` component from there:

```tsx
// Before
import { GenericInput } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

// After
import { InputRenderer } from '@strapi/strapi/admin';
```

Note, that the `InputRenderer` component has a different API, and you should refer to the documentation for the `InputRenderer` component.

### InjectionZone

This component has been removed and not replaced. However, you can easily replicate this in your own project by using the `useStrapiApp` hook:

```tsx
const MyComponent = ({ area, ...compProps }) => {
  const { getPlugin } = useStrapiApp();

  const [pluginName, page, position] = area.split('.');

  const plugin = getPlugin(pluginName);
  const components = plugin?.getInjectedComponents(page, position);

  if (!plugin || !components) {
    return null;
  }

  return components.map(({ name, Component }) => <Component key={name} {...props} />);
};
```

### Link

This was aliasing the design-system and using the `as` prop with `react-router-dom`. You should import the component from there:

```tsx
// Before
import { Link } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

// After
import { Link } from '@strapi/design-system/v2';
import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

const MyLink = () => {
  return (
    <Link as={NavLink} to="/my-link">
      My Link
    </Link>
  );
};
```

### LinkButton

This was aliasing the design-system and using the `as` prop with `react-router-dom`. You should import the component from there:

```tsx
// Before
import { LinkButton } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

// After
import { LinkButton } from '@strapi/design-system/v2';
import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

const MyLink = () => {
  return (
    <LinkButton as={NavLink} to="/my-link">
      My Link
    </LinkButton>
  );
};
```

### LoadingIndicatorPage

This component has been removed and refactored to be part of the `Page` component exported from `@strapi/strapi/admin`. You should use the `Page` component from there:

```tsx
// Before
import { LoadingIndicatorPage } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

// After
import { Page } from '@strapi/strapi/admin';

const MyPage = () => {
  // ...

  if (isLoading) {
    return <Page.Loading />;
  }

  // ...
};
```

### NoContent

This component has been removed and not replaced, you should use the `EmptyStateLayout` component from `@strapi/design-system`.

### NoMedia

### NoPermissions

This component has been removed and refactored to be part of the `Page` component exported from `@strapi/strapi/admin`. You should use the `Page` component from there:

```tsx

// After

const MyPage = () => {
  // ...

  if (!canRead) {
    return <Page.NoPermissions />;
  }

  // ...
};
```

### NotAllowedInput

This component has been removed and not replaced. If you feel like you need this component, please open an issue on the Strapi repository to discuss your usecase. You can easily replicate this in your own project by using the `TextInput` from `@strapi/design-system`:

```tsx
import { TextInput } from '@strapi/design-system';

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <TextInput disabled placeholder="No permissions to see this field" type="text" {...props} />
  );
};
```

### PageSizeURLQuery

This component was moved to the `admin` package and can now be imported via the `@strapi/strapi` package as part of the composite component `Pagination`:

```tsx
// Before
import { PageSizeURLQuery } from '@strapi/helper-plugin';

// After
import { Pagination } from '@strapi/strapi/admin';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Pagination.Root>
      <Pagination.PageSize />
    </Pagination.Root>
  );
};
```

Note, there were some slightly behavioural changes i.e. the PageSize won't render if the lowest pageSize is 10 but you only have 9 entries. Due to the refactor some props will have moved and changed, please look at the documentation for the Pagination component for more info.

### PaginationURLQueryProps

This component was moved to the `admin` package and can now be imported via the `@strapi/strapi` package as part of the composite component `Pagination`:

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Pagination.Root pageCount={2}>
      <Pagination.Links />
    </Pagination.Root>
  );
};
```
