# Strapi plugin Settings Manager

⚠️ This package is deprecated ⚠️

We have decided to deprecate this package because we believe that this plugin should be integrated in the `strapi-admin` package.
As we are building a plugin ecosystem we know that many plugins will have configurations and those configurations should be served by the core package.
This plugin was originally thought to allow developers to set databases, their server configurations using the UI. However this configurations since these settings are for advanced developers we think that they are at ease with using the appropriate files to do so.
