## Why Strapi?

> At [Strapi](http://strapi.io), everything we do we believe in changing the status quo of web development. Our products are simple to use, user friendly and production-ready.

Web and mobile applications needed a powerful, simple to use and production-ready API-driven framework. That's why we created Strapi, an open-source [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) rich framework for building applications and services.

Strapi enables developers to focus on writing reusable application logic instead of spending time building infrastructure. It is designed for building practical, production-ready Node.js applications in a matter of hours instead of weeks.
