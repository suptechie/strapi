[Strapi](http://strapi.io) is an open source solution to create, deploy and manage your own API. It provides a powerful dashboard and features to make your life easier.

## v3.0.0 coming soon...
We've been working on a major update to Strapi for several months now, rewriting the core framework and the dashboard. Some parts of this work have been merged into our master branch. Currently, this is not stable and ready.

**Please DON'T use the `master` branch in production. To run and start your current project, we strongly recommend to use the v1.5.4.**

For more information on the upcoming version, please take a look to our [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md).

## Why Strapi ?

> At [Strapi](http://strapi.io), everything we do we believe in changing the status quo of web development. Our products are simple to use, user friendly and production-ready.

Web and mobile applications needed a powerful, simple to use and production-ready API-driven solution. That's why we created Strapi, an open-source Content Management Framework (CMF) for exposing your content (data, media) accross multi-devices.

Halfway between a CMS and a framework, Strapi takes advantages of both worlds. A powerful dashboard to easily manage your content with a flexible framework layer to develop and integrate specific features.

## Features

- **Dashboard**, is a complete UI to manage your app. If you try it, you'll like it!
- **100% JavaScript**, the language you probably already are using for the front-end.
- **Useful CLI** that let you scaffold projects and APIs on the fly.
- **Front-end agnostic** and can be used with React, Vue, Angular, Backbone, Ember, iOS, Android, etc.
- **Security layers** that just work and ships reusable security policies.
- **WebSockets** to handle realtime connections and events.
- **Mongo** as a main database to store your data with efficiency.

## Plugins

> Only what you need. No more. No less.

Thanks to the plugins, you will be able to create the perfect app without useless features. The Strapi ecosystem has been thought to be the most granular as possible. Please [read our blog](http://blog.strapi.io/everything-you-need-to-know-about-strapi-v3/) to get more details about them.
