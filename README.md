## Quick start

We've been working on a major update to Strapi for several months now, rewriting the core framework and the administration panel. Performances has been increased, Developer eXperience has been improved and a brand new plugins
ecosystem has been introduced. Both versions are available, we recommend v1 for production use.

#### Alpha

The alpha has support for the latest version of Node.js (v8) and is going to be ready for production for the end of the year.
```bash
npm install strapi@alpha -g
```

#### Stable
This is the stable version of Strapi (v1). However, the migration to v3 will not be easy due to many breaking changes.
```bash
npm install strapi -g
```

Read the [Getting started](http://strapi.io/documentation#getting-started) page to create your first project using Strapi.

## Should I use v3 or v1?
We've been working on a major update to Strapi for several months now, rewriting the core framework and the administration panel. Performances has been increased, Developer eXperience has been improved and a brand new plugins
ecosystem has been introduced.

The v3 is not ready for production use yet. However, if you're planning to build a new project, we recommend to start using the latest version available (v3). There will be minor changes and the migration time will be lower than migrating from v1 to v3.

For more information on the upcoming version, please take a look to our [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md).
