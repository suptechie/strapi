<!--
⚠️ We have stopped merging new PRs, for now, into the Strapi core.
The reason is that we are developing a new architecture for both the admin panel and for the plugins.
This new architecture will provide stability to the Strapi core as we approach the release of Beta.
We appreciate and welcome all your contributions, but until further notice, please do not submit a PR as it will not be merged.
Furthermore, your pull request will have to be rewritten for the new architecture.
