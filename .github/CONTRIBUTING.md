## Reporting an issue

Before reporting an issue you need to make sure:
- You are experiencing a concrete technical issue with Strapi (ideas and feature proposals should happen [on Slack](http://slack.strapi.io)).
- You are not asking a question about how to use Strapi or about whether or not Strapi has a certain feature. For general help using Strapi, please refer to [the official Strapi documentation](http://strapi.io). For additional help, ask a question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/strapi).
- You have already searched for related [issues](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues), and found none open (if you found a related _closed_ issue, please link to it in your post).
- Your issue title is concise, on-topic and polite.
- You can provide steps to reproduce this issue that others can follow.
- You have tried all the following (if relevant) and your issue remains:
  - Make sure you have the right application started.
  - Make sure you've killed the Strapi server with CTRL+C and started it again.
  - Make sure you closed any open browser tabs pointed at `localhost` before starting Strapi.
  - Make sure you do not have any other Strapi applications running in other terminal windows.
  - Make sure the application you are using to reproduce the issue has a clean `node_modules` directory, meaning:
    * no dependencies are linked (e.g. you haven't run `npm link`)
    * that you haven't made any inline changes to files in the `node_modules` folder
    * that you don't have any weird global dependency loops. The easiest way to double-check any of the above, if you aren't sure, is to run: `$ rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clear && npm install`.
