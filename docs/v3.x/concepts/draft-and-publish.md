# Draft and publish

The draft and publish feature allows you to save your content as a draft, to publish it later.

## Deactivating the draft and publish mode

By default, the draft and publish feature is activated for all newly created collection and single types. It is however possible to deactive the feature at content type level (i.e. it can be activated for one content type, but deactivated for another).

::: warning
If the feature is deactivated while contents are saved as drafts, they will automatically be deleted. Make sure all contents are published before deactivating the feature.
:::

To deactivate the draft and publish mode for a content type:

1. Go the Plugins > Content-Types Builder.
2. Select the collection or single type for which you want draft & publish mode to be deactivated.
3. Click on the Edit [] button to access the content type's configurations.
4. Click on the "Advanced Settings" tab.
5. In the DRAFT/PUBLISH section, click on the **OFF** button.
6. Click on the **Finish** button to confirm the deactivation of the feature.

Drafts can be modified and saved at will, until the content is ready to be published.
