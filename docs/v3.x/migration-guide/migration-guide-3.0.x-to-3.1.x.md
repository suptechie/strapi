# Migration guide from 3.0.x to 3.1.x

**Make sure your server is not running until the end of the migration**

## Summary

1. [Upgrading your dependencies](#_1-upgrading-your-dependencies)
2. [Define the admin JWT Token](#_2-define-the-admin-jwt-token)
3. [Migrate you custom admin panel plugins](#_3-migrate-your-custom-admin-panel-plugins)
4. [Rebuild the admin panel](#_4-rebuild-the-admin-panel)

## 1. Upgrading your dependencies

First, run the following command to get the last version of `3.1.x`:
```bash
npm info strapi@3.1.x version
```
Then, update your `package.json` with the highest version given by the previous command.

**Example â€”** `package.json`

```json
{
  // ...
  "dependencies": {
    "strapi": "$version",
    "strapi-admin": "$version",
    "strapi-connector-bookshelf": "$version",
    "strapi-plugin-content-manager": "$version",
    "strapi-plugin-content-type-builder": "$version",
    "strapi-plugin-email": "$version",
    "strapi-plugin-graphql": "$version",
    "strapi-plugin-upload": "$version",
    "strapi-plugin-users-permissions": "$version",
    "strapi-utils": "$version"
  }
}
```

:::tip NOTE
Make sure to replace `$version` with the highest version given by the previous command.
:::

Finally, update your `dependencies` with one of the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

## 2. Define the admin JWT Token

This version comes with a new feature: Role & Permissions for the administrators. In the process, the authentication system for administrators has been updated and the `secret` used to encode the jwt token is not automatically generated anymore.
In order to make the login work again you need to define the `secret` you want to use in `server.js`.

**Example â€”** `config/server.js`

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  // ...
  admin: {
    auth: {
      secret: env('ADMIN_JWT_SECRET', 'example-secret'),
    },
  },
});
```

::: warning
For security concerns, you must change `example-secret` by your own sophisticated secret.
:::

:::tip NOTE
All the administrator will be disconnected from the app and will need to log in again.
:::


## 3. Migrate your custom admin panel plugins

If you don't have custom plugins, you can jump to the next section.

In  order to display your custom plugin link into the mail `LeftMenu` you need to update the plugin registration by adding `icon`, `name` and `menu` in the following file.

**Path â€”** `plugins/${pluginName}/admin/src/index.js`

```js
export default strapi => {
  // ...
  const icon = pluginPkg.strapi.icon;
  const name = pluginPkg.strapi.name;
  const plugin = {
    // ...
    icon,
    name,
    menu: {
      // Set a link into the PLUGINS section
      pluginsSectionLinks: [
        {
          destination: `/plugins/${pluginId}`, // Endpoint of the link
          icon,
          name,
          label: {
            id: `${pluginId}.plugin.name`, // Refers to a i18n
            defaultMessage: 'MY PLUGIN',
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

## 4. Rebuild the admin panel

Rebuild the admin panel with one of the following commands:

```bash
yarn build --clean
# or
npm run build -- --clean
```
