All backend code can be found in:

```
 packages/core/content-releases/server
```

## Content-types

The content-releases plugin creates two hidden content-types.

### Release

The `Release` content type stores all the information about a release and its associated Release Actions. It is saved in the database as `strapi_releases`. The schema can be found in:

```
packages/core/content-releases/server/src/content-types/release/schema.ts
```

### Release Action

Th `Release Action` content type is associated with any entry from any content-type that has draft and publish enabled. It is responsible for storing the action to perform for an associated entry. It is saved in the database as `strapi_release_actions`. The schema can be found in:

```
packages/core/content-releases/server/src/content-types/release-action/schema.ts
```

Release and Release Action routes are only accessible on the Admin API.
