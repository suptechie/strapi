## Summary

By **default review workflows are disabled on all content-types** and users have to enable one workflow
per content-type. This can be achieved in the "Advanced Settings" Tab of the edit content-type
modal.

Similar to draft & publish review-workflows registers a new input component type called `toggle-review-workflows`
which is used to render the checkbox component.

**Note**: _Ideally the code should have been placed in the `ee` folder to be
under the enterprise license, but neither the content-type-builder nor the babel-plugin to transpile the ee code had support for this._

## Endpoints

### `PUT /content-type-builder/content-types/[content-type-uid]`

Toggle review workflows for the content-type.

#### Payload

```ts
{
  components: [],
  contentType: {
    attributes: {},
    reviewWorkflows: boolean
  }
}
```
