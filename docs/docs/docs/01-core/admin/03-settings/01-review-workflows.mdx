## Summary

The settings page for review workflows is where users can add and edit stages in any workflow. A stage is a step within
each workflow. It is only **accessible in enterprise mode** and if the read permission `admin::review-workflows.read` is set to `true`.

Upon mount the settings page injects itself into the global redux store under the namespace `settings_review-workflows`. Redux is
then used for all state management updates on the settings page. `Formik` is used to render and validate the list of stages. It
is integrated with redux, so that all input components are controlled components.

### Form submission

The form the wraps workflow stages submits all stages at once, because we expect the number of stages per workflow to be
rather small. Because of this we can simply re-order stages by sending a different order. Every stage that sends a corresponding `id`
attribute will be re-ordered and not created. Stages without an `id` property will be created in the database on submission.

### Stage deletion

In case a stage is deleted, all **entities which are connected to that stage are moved to the previous stage**. Because a stage deletion
might have big effects on the database, a confirmation is shown when a stage is up for deletion.

Changes are only applied if the user hits "Save". It is not possible to remove all stages from a workflow (neither in the UI nor the API).

### Hooks

#### `useReviewWorkflows({ id?: number })`

This hook allows to fetch either one (if `id` is passed) or all workflows at once. By default all stages are populated. The
hooks returns a react-query result. This hook is used to fetch a workflow on the settings page and the content-manager edit view.

The API returns an `array` of workflows.

```ts
useReviewWorkflows(queryParams: object): {
  workflows: Workflow[],
  isLoading: boolean,
  status: string,
  refetch: () => Promise<void>,
}
```

### Data shapes

```ts
type Stage {
    id: int
    name: string // max-length: 255 characters
    createdAt: Date
    updatedAt: Date
}

type Worklow {
    id: int,
    stages: Stage[]
    createdAt: Date
    updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Endpoints

#### `GET /admin/review-workflows/workflows/`

Returns a list of all workflows. Stages can be populated using `?populate=stages`.

#### `PUT /admin/review-workflows/workflows/`

Update workflow stages.

##### Payload

```ts
{
  data: Stage[]
}
```

**Note**: All stages need to be submitted. Stages without an `id` attribute will be created. The order of stages is persisted in the database.
