## Usage

The following example shows a basic way to use the `useFetchClient` hook to make a get request to a Strapi backend endpoint:

```jsx
import {useState} from "react"
import useFetchClient from '@strapi/admin/admin/src/hooks/useFetchClient';

const Component = () => {
    const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
    const { get } = useFetchClient();
    const requestURL = "/some-endpoint";

    const handleGetData = async () => {
        const { data } = await get(requestURL);
        setItems(data.items);
    }

    return(
        <div>
            <div>
                {
                    items && items.map(item => <h2 key={item.uuid}>{item.name}</h2>))
                }
            </div>
            <button onClick={handleGetData}>Show Items</button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

## Methods

Essentially, this is an abstraction around the axios instance exposed by a hook. It provides a simple interface to handle API calls to the Strapi backend.
It handles request cancellations inside the hook with an [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController). This is typically triggered when the component is unmounted so all the requests that it is currently making are aborted.

The hook exposes four methods:

- **get(url, config)**: requires a relative url (`string`) and makes a `GET` request to the Strapi backend with an optional configuration `object` passed as second parameter.
- **post(url, data, config)**: requires a relative url (`string`) and makes a `POST` request with the required data `object` to the Strapi backend with the optional configuration `object` passed as third parameter.
- **put(url, data, config)**: requires a relative url (`string`) and makes a `PUT` request with the required data `object` to the Strapi backend with the optional configuration `object` passed as third parameter.
- **del(url, config)**: requires a relative url (`string`) and makes a `DELETE` request to the Strapi backend with an optional configuration `object` passed as second parameter.

## Implementation details

The fetch instance is running axios under the hook with two request interceptors.

### Base URL

The default URL will be the one defined in the environment variable: `STRAPI_ADMIN_BACKEND_URL`.

### Interceptors

#### Request

The request interceptor adds the following parameters to the header:

```js
{
    Authorization: `Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>`,
    Accept: 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}
```

#### Response

If everything has gone correctly, the response is returned as it comes from the backend. However, if it cointains a **status code of 401**, the authentication details will be removed from
the application storage and the window will be reload

:::caution
Have this in mind if using this hook in pages where the auth token is not available, such as login, because it will create an infinite loop if not treating the error correctly. See section [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication problems

Trying to access a protected route from a context where the auth token is not available may lead to an infinite loop, because of the response interceptor that
reloads the page when obtaining a 401 response. One option available to avoid this from happening is to not considering a 401 response as an error, as follows:

```js
const {
  data: { data: properties },
} = await get(`/protected-endpoint`, {
  validateStatus: (status) => status < 500,
});
```
