- API reference for useRBACProvider hook (which is just a wrapper around useContext) & methods

---

- There's two helper components

  - CheckPagePermissions this is for views
  - CheckPermissions this is for components/fields etc.

---

- useRBAC hook which is more of an actual hook

  - how does it work with REDUX?

---

- useSyncRBAC hook (only in content manager LOL) (write about it here cause it's important but then add a doc in the CM documentation linking back to this)
  - it gets the permissions specific to a content-type and then a particular view of that content-type e.g. ADDRESSES and just the list-view
  - then passes "allowedActions" to `EditViewDataManagerProvider` so then write something on permissions in the content-manager cause that's obvs unique nice.
