# Installation Requirements

### üëã Welcome onboard!

Welcome to the open source [headless CMS](https://strapi.io) developers love. Our users love Strapi because it is open source, MIT licensed, fully customizable and based on nodejs. Strapi lets you manage your content and distribute it anywhere.

This page covers installing the [basic installation requirements for Strapi](#basic-installation-requirements).

(After you install these requirements, the [Quick Start](/3.x.x/getting-started/quick-start.html) guide will walk you through how to: [create a project](quick-start.html#_1-create-a-project), [create an admin user](quick-start.html#_2-create-an-admin-user), [create a content type](quick-start.html#_3-create-a-content-type), [manage and add data to content type](quick-start.html#_4-manage-and-add-data-to-content-type), [set roles and permissions](quick-start.html#_5-set-roles-and-permissions) and [consume the content type API](quick-start.html#_6-consume-the-content-type-api).)

## Basic Installation Requirements

Strapi requires just two basic installation steps:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). We recommend using version 10.x or later.
2. Install [Strapi](https://strapi.io). Install the latest version of Strapi.

These two requirements are all that is needed to get Strapi up and running on your development environment.

## Install Node (and NPM)

Strapi needs Nodejs and NPM installed. NPM installs at the same time as Nodejs. You can following the below instructions to install Nodejs on Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 and Mac O/S Mojave.

#### Installation Instructions for each Operating System:

::: windows
**WINDOWS 10**

### Install Node.js (and NPM) on Windows 10

There are several methods to install Nodejs on _Windows 10_.

We will follow the most common download and installation procedure. These _instructions are for Windows 10_. (If you are installing on a different version of Windows or if you have trouble following these instructions, please review the [official Nodejs documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).)

1. Download the Windows Installer from the [downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You will need to choose the 32-bit or 64-bit version. We recommend the LTS (long-term support) version of Nodejs.
2. Double-click the node-v10.x.x-x86.msi file icon. Click "Next" for the default options and to install Nodejs under the recommended and most common settings. After clicking "Next" several times, click "Install" to install nodejs. When it is done installing, click "Finish".
3. Verify both Nodejs and NPM have installed correctly. Open your Command Prompt:
   - Click your Start Button
   - In Search type, "cmd"
   - Then click on "Command Prompt".
   - Type the following commands in your Command Prompt

Verify Nodejs has correctly installed:

```shell
$ node -v
## You should see "v10.x.x
```

Next, verify NPM has correctly installed:

```shell
$ npm -v
## You should see "6.x.x"
```

All done. Next you need to [install Strapi globally](#install-strapi-globally).

## Install Strapi globally

Time to install Strapi!

We will now install Strapi. Strapi installs with one command. The command is the same for Windows, Mac or Ubuntu.
::: danger WARNING
Strapi must be installed globally, using the "-g" flag, to avoid problems.
:::

```bash
$ npm install strapi@alpha -g
```

::: warning NOTE
If you encounter npm permissions issues, [change the permissions to npm default directory](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions#option-1-change-the-permission-to-npms-default-directory).

(Installation takes about 20 seconds with a good Internet connection. Take a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è break if your internet is slow.)
