[Strapi](http://strapi.io) is an open source solution to create, deploy and manage your own API. It provides a powerful dashboard and features to make your life easier.

## v3.0.0 coming soon...
We've been working on a major update for Strapi during the past months, rewriting the core framework and the dashboard. Some parts of this work have been merged into our master branch. Currently, this is not stable and ready.

**Please DON'T use the `master` branch in production. To run and start your current project, we strongly recommend to use the v1.6.3.**

For more informations on the upcoming version, please take a look to our [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md).

Also, we need your opinion about the next features you would like. Please answer our [latest survey about Strapi v3](http://bit.ly/2v7MAdn).

## Why Strapi ? (other version)

> At [Strapi](http://strapi.io), we believe that we can change the status quo of web development. Our products are simple to use, user-friendly and production-ready.


Web and mobile applications need a powerful, user-friendly and production-ready API-driven solution. That's why we created Strapi, an open-source Content Management Framework (CMF) to expose your content (data, media) across multi-devices.

Halfway between a CMS and a framework, Strapi takes advantage of both worlds. A powerful dashboard to easily manage your content with a flexible framework layer to develop and integrate specific features.

## Features

- **Dashboard**, is a complete UI to manage your app. If you try it, you'll like it!
- **100% JavaScript**, the language you are probably already using for the front-end.
- **Useful CLI** that lets you scaffold projects and APIs on the fly.
- **Front-end agnostic** that can be used with React, Vue, Angular, Backbone, Ember, iOS, Android, etc.
- **Security layers** that just work and ship reusable security policies.
- **WebSockets** to handle realtime connections and events.
- **Mongo** as a main database to store your data with efficiency.

## Plugins

> Only what you need. No more. No less.

Thanks to the plugins, you will be able to create the perfect app without useless features. Strapi's ecosystem has been thought to be the most granular as possible. Please [read our blog](http://blog.strapi.io/everything-you-need-to-know-about-strapi-v3/) to get more details about them.
